**For the full-stack web development  24/25**

Steps to download and run:
1. Make sure you have NodeJS installed on your machine ([Download NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/))
2. Make sure you have Git installed on your machine ([Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git))
2. In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to download the project
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/Mxr1am/eventitude`
4. Once the project has finished downloading, navigate into the projects root directory `cd eventitude`
5. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies for the project
6. Once the dependencies have installed, run the server using `npm run dev`. You will see a message saying that the server is running on port 3333.
7. In a **separate terminal window** navigate to the projects root directory and run `npm run test` to run the tests. The tests will mostly fail, but that is because we have not yet written any code.


**Things to remember:**
1. To re-run the tests, you can first wipe the DB by running `npm run wipe`. The tests assume a fresh database each time.
documentation is located on Swagger [here](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/MMU-SE/eventitude/1.0.0/)
